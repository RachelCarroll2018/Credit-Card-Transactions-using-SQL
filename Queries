-- Some fraudsters hack a credit card by making several small transactions, how can we isolate transactions of each cardholder to show small transactions?
SELECT *
FROM transactions_2
WHERE amount < 2;

-- Count the transactions that are less than $2 per cardholder
SELECT COUNT(amount) FROM transactions_2
WHERE amount <2;
-- Answer: There are 350 transactions that are less than $2

-- Is there any evidence to suggest a credit card has been hacked? Explain your rationale:
-- Answer: Even though there are a lot of recurring smaller charges made by the same merchant over this data set, there isn't enough information to prove fraud from this information alone. We would need to understand the merchant's typical spending habits, have they purchased from the seller before, and more.

--What are the top 100 highest transactions made between 7:00 am and 9:00 am?
SELECT *
FROM transactions_2
WHERE date_part('hour', transactions_2.date) > 7 AND date_part('hour', transactions_2.date) < 9
ORDER BY amount DESC
LIMIT 100;

-- Do you see any anomalous transactions that could be fraudulent?
-- ANSWER: From 7 am to 9 am, 95% of the data set's transactions were $20.44 or below. The other 5% of transactions had a large jump in amount, with the top transaction being $1,617 and the respective 4 below being $1131, $1060, $1017, and $748. Given that the overwhelming majority of transactions are $20 or less, these amounts could be considered fraudulent.

-- Is there a higher number of fraudulent transactions made during this time frame versus the rest of the day?
-- 1 am to 3 am = 6 atypical transactions : $1203, $1029, $1014, $691, $325, $137

-- 3 am to 5 am = 2 atypical transactions : $1795, $389

-- 5 am to 7 am = 7 atypical transactions : $2001, $1813, $1678, $1160, $1063, $1046, $543

-- 9 am to 11 am = 4 atypical transactions : $1001, $852, $283, $233

-- 11 am to 1 pm = 3 atypical transactions : $1154, $245, $178

-- 1 pm to 3 pm = 2 atypical transactions : $1398, $757

-- 3 pm to 5 pm = 5 atypical transactions : $1723, $1159, $1072, $313, $117

-- 5 pm to 7 pm = 4 atypical transactions : $ 1179, $1177, $525, $269

-- 7 pm to 9 pm = 4 atypical transactions : $1814, $1123, $267, $188

-- 9 pm to 11 pm = 4 atypical transactions : $ 1839, $1176, $1108, $393

-- ANSWER: Looking at the data results above, the only other times of day that had more fraudulent transactions were between 1 am - 3 am, and 5 am - 7 am, so there is a trend for fraudulent activity early in the morning.

-- If you answered yes to the previous question, explain why you think there might be fraudulent transactions during this time frame.
-- ANSWER: I would think there is a larger amount of fraudulent transactions during this time due to people mostly being asleep or just starting their day, they aren't looking directly at their bank account first thing in the morning.
